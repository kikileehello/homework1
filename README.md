## Briefe self-introduction

I've only taken the course __Fundamentals of Computer Programming__ and leaned some basics of **_C programming language_**. But Bioinformatics is so useful that I think every researcher who is in biology or medicine files should acuqire some bioinformatics skills. Knowing this must be really difficult for me, I still took this challenge, ~~hope I can stick to the end of this sysmester~~.

## What I want to acquire from this course?

1. Knowing when can I use bioinformatics to improve my proccessing or results analysing
2. When facing high-throughput data, how can I deal with them.
* Unordered sub-list. 
* DNA sequencing 
* RNA sequencing
* unordered

> 3. Why my unordered sub-list can not show on the preview?
